		      WylieWord Build Procedure

This explains how to make a new version of WylieWord.

The program source file is called "WylieWord developement copy.dot".
This is what you edit with the VBA editor.

When you have finished modifying it:

Do a search for, and remove, all debugging MsgBox calls.

I use "!!!" in comments to note known bugs that should be dealt with.
Search for "!!!" and make sure anything left in that state is
acceptable in the release.

Re-test everything that has changed since the last release, and
anything that might be affected by those changes.  Do the testing with
the template loaded from the Word Startup folder.  For some reason,
Word runs VBA differently when loaded from there; specifically, missing
type declarations are more likely to result in run-time errors.

Increment the version number in AboutWylieWord.

Run PrepareDistribution in immediate window.
  This runs automated tests.  Verify that the results are OK.
  It also unbinds all the WylieWord keys.  
    This is critical to having WylieWord work correctly on
      non-English keyboards.
    After making the distribution, you will want to restore
      the keybindings in the develoment copy by calling 
      WylieWordBindKeys.

Save "WylieWord development copy.dot"

Copy it to the build folder.
Rename it Setup.doc.

If the manual has changed, update its revision date.

The WylieWord installer is created using the program "SEAU",
available for $49 on the web.  The .INP file is its configuration.

In SEAU:

  Update the Files folder to be the WylieWord build folder (if it isn't already).
  Update the Archive output file location to be in that folder also.
  Save the SEAU configuration (.INP file) if you have changed it.
  Run the SEAU builder.
  Run the resulting self-extracting .exe file.

Re-test everything.
