<h2>Why do I need a THDL username?</h2>
<p>
THDL offers a variety of resources such as the Community Roster, the
Tibetan  Dictionary,  the  Audio-Video  database  and so forth which
allow  general users to customize these resources to their needs, as
well  as  collaborators from around the world to simultaneously work
on building the resources. To faciliate use of THDL, we have created
a  unified  THDL  login  ID  respository  that  can  be  utilized to
personalize your use of THDL, as well as access your own information
within  THDL.  Once  you  have created your own THDL ID, you can use
that single ID to maintain your own resources and preferences within
THDL.  If you have never before registered with THDL and lack an ID,
then  you  will  need  to  first  register and obtain a personalized
username/password for this purpose. For example, individuals wanting
to  create a Community Roster entry for themselves will first need a
THDL user name in order to create a roster entry. To create your own
THDL ID, please <a jwcid="register2">click here</a>.
</p>

<h2>THDL Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We will never rent, lend, sell or otherwise distribute your e-mail address, street address or phone number to anyone. 
The Community Roster <em>is</em> a publically accessible directory, however, so if you do not wish your 
contact information to be made public, please do not include it in your entry.
