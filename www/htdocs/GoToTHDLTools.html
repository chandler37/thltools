<h1>THDL Tools at SourceForge</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the home of software tools for the

  <a href="http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/">
    Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library</a>

  (THDL).&nbsp; Here you can find Jskad, QuillDriver, Savant, the
  Tibetan Machine Web fonts, and other useful pieces of software.
</p>

<p>
  More information about these tools can be found at the THDL's

  <a href="http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/tools/index.html">
    Tools site</a>.

  &nbsp; Please refer to that site first, and come back here only
  if you don't find what you're looking for.
</p>

<p>
  The only real reason to visit these web pages, rather than the
  THDL's much more useful pages, is to

  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61934">
    download old versions or alpha versions</a>

  of the software (note that the current releases are
  available for download from

  <a href="http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/tools/index.html">
    the main THDL Tools site</a>),

  to

  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=61934">
    submit bug reports or feature requests</a>,

  to help contribute to the project, etc.  If you're trying to do
  any of these things, we hope you'll understand why we haven't spent
  any time making this site very good-looking or easy to use.&nbsp;
  Instead, you'll have to see our

  <a href="THDLTools_Developers.html">
    developers' site</a>

  or find your way through the maze of options available at the

  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/thdltools">
    THDLTools project page</a>.

  &nbsp; If the above description doesn't match you, and you feel
  that you've had to wade through the impenetrable project page for
  something that

  <a href="http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/tools/index.html">
    the main THDL Tools site</a>

  should have provided, please

  <a href="mailto:dchandler@users.sourceforge.net">let us know</a>

  of your experience so that we can make the THDL tools more
  accessible.
</p>

<p>
  Once again, your two best bets for information related to the THDL
  software tools are:
  <ul>
     <li>

       <a href="http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/tools/index.html">
         the main THDL Tools site</a>

       (a good-looking, easy-to-use site)
     </li>
     <li>

       <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/thdltools">
         the THDLTools project page</a>

       at SourceForge (a very technical, hard-to-use site)
     </li>
  </ul>
</p>

DO NOT DELETE THE SF.NET LOGO.

We have a choice of colors and sizes for this logo (see
"https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=790&group_id=1"),
but we do not have the option of removing it.  SourceForge requests
that we put it on each web page for our project, and to give us
incentive to do so, they will not track the number of hits for our
project web pages unless we put this link in.  To track hits, see
"http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/index.php?report=months&group_id=61934".
