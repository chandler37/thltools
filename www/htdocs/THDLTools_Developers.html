<h1>Info for THDL Tools Developers</h1>

<p>
  This page is an attempt at extracting knowledge about the internals
  of the THDL tools from the hired guns and disseminating it more
  widely.  This page attempts to cover both low-level (e.g., which
  API?) and high-level (e.g., which user interface?) issues.

  <a href="#related">
    Related projects</a>

  are also discussed.
</p>

<p>
  The only thing we personally have got up on the web that's any use
  thus far are
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      our Javadoc <a href="pubapi/">API docs</a> [grab the whole <a
      href="public-javadocs.zip">zip file</a>] (see also these <a
      href="privateapi/">API docs</a> [grab the whole <a
      href="private-javadocs.zip">zip file</a>] that contain private
      class members).
    </li>
    <li>
      a description of our <a href="BuildSystems.html"> build
      systems</a> that tells you how to compile, run, and cut releases
      for our tools
    </li>
    <li>
      a <a href="TibetanFormatConverterDesign.html">design
      document</a> concerning the Tibetan Format Converter.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Here are some links to tools of interest:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Jskad, Savant and QuillDriver use an Ant build system.&nbsp; See

      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">
        Apache Ant</a>

      or jump right to the

      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/coretasklist.html">
        documentation</a>

      for the tasks of which we make use.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our unit tests use the

      <a href="http://junit.org/">
        JUnit</a>

      framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      Savant and QuillDriver make use of the

      <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/">
        Java(TM) Media Framework API</a>

      and <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/"> QuickTime for
      Java</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In our Java(TM) code, we load some classes at run-time.&nbsp; To
      understand the mechanisms behind
      this--<code>Class.forName(String)</code> and thread context
      class loaders, etc.--read

      <a href="http://www.javageeks.com/Papers/ClassForName/">
        this JavaGeeks white paper</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our Java code uses XML.  We use

      <a href="http://jdom.org/">
        JDOM</a>,

      <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">
        Xalan</a> (XSLT),

      and

      <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/index.html">
        Xerces</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      We use the Ant Task Suite provided by Venus Application
      Publisher (Vamp) to make putting releases up via Java Web Start
      less painful.  See

      <a href="http://www.vamphq.com/ant.html">
        VampHQ</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>


<h3>Related Projects<a name="related"></a></h3>
<p>
  Below are links to some Java text editors or word processors that we
  might learn from or integrate with.  This list is by no means
  comprehensive.  I started my search from

  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=63&amp;discrim=198">
    SF.net's software map</a>,

  by the way (and see

  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=70&amp;discrim=198">
    this corner of the map</a>,

  too), and haven't yet done anything more.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The GPL'ed

      <a href="http://vietpad.sourceforge.net/">
        VietPad</a>,

      written in Java, (for entering Vietnamese language in Unicode-8
      or -16) may teach us something, though integration doesn't seem
      useful (because it is primitive) and would require changing our
      license to the GPL.
    </li>
    <li>
      The GPL'ed

      <a href="http://jedit.sourceforge.net/">
        JEdit</a>

      bills itself as a "programmer's text editor", but it supports
      Unicode, is 100% Java, is very popular, and is extremely
      extensible, making integration while keeping our
      non-GPL-compatible license a possibility.  Definitely worth a
      second look.
    </li>
    <li>
      The GPL'ed

      <a href="http://yudit.org/">
        Yudit</a>

      is an X11 application that supports Unicode in a big way.  Their

      <a href="http://yudit.org/">
        website</a>

      has many links of interest to us as we ponder Unicode
      compatibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      The GPL'ed/LGPL'ed

      <a href="http://www.prometheas.com/projects/_syggrafeus/index.html">
        Syggrafeus/Rosetta Stone Library</a>

      is a Java library for Unicode multi-lingual something-or-other.
    </li>
    <li>
      The GPL'ed

      <a href="http://sted.sourceforge.net/">
        STED</a>

      is a Java transliterator for many languages.
    </li>
    <li>
      The GPL'ed

      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/words-of-magic/">
        Words of Magic</a>
      
      is a very simple word processor for English and Dutch.
    </li>
    <li>
      The GPL'ed

      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jgloss/">
        JGloss</a>
      
      says this about itself: "JGloss lets you import Japanese text
      documents and add reading and translation annotations for words,
      both automatically during import, and manually. It is written in
      Java."
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Finally, the

  <a href="http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/">
    EpiDoc</a>

  project (hosted by SourceForge) does not yet have any tools up, but
  the project's goals are similar in many ways to the THDL's, and they
  list their programming language as Java.  The blurb of interest:
  "The EpiDoc Collaborative is developing a software and
  hardware-independent digital publication and interchange
  specification for scholarly and educational editions of inscribed
  and incised texts in Greek, Latin and other ancient languages".

DO NOT DELETE THE SF.NET LOGO.

We have a choice of colors and sizes for this logo (see
"https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=790&group_id=1"),
but we do not have the option of removing it.  SourceForge requests
that we put it on each web page for our project, and to give us
incentive to do so, they will not track the number of hits for our
project web pages unless we put this link in.  To track hits, see
