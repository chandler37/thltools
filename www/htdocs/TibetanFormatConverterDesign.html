<h2>Tibetan Format Converter Design Document</h2>

<p>
  This document describes the design of a mechanism for converting
  from any of a number of representations of Tibetan+Roman text to any
  of a number of representations.  This converter will store
  Tibetan+Roman text internally in a
  org.thdl.tib.text.TibetanDocument, and it will use a
  org.thdl.tib.text.TibetanKeyboard to populate a TibetanDocument.
  These two classes exist presently inside the Jskad application, but
  will be modified as needed so that servlets, console applications,
  and AWT/Swing-based applications can all make use of them.
</p>

<p>
  The difficulty is in fault-tolerance, reliability (DLC address both
  verification AND validation), and speed.  Speed will be of least
  concern.
</p>

<h3>Input formats</h3>

<p>
  The converter will support, in a modular fashion, <b>mixed Tibetan
  and Roman</b> input in the following formats:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      An HTML file with embedded &lt;tibetan
      translit="extended-wylie"&gt;sgra&lt;/tibetan&gt; tags (from the
      SimpleTibetanAndRomanDocument DTD mentioned below)
    </li>
    <li>
      Unicode (regardless of the order of consonants in a stack)
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for TibetanMachine
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for TibetanMachineWeb
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for Sambhota Old
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for Sambhota New
    </li>
    <li>
      Edward and Than's XHTML
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  In addition, the converter will support, in a modular fashion,
  <b>strictly Tibetan</b> input in the following formats:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Extended Wylie, ACIP, and any other format for which there
      exists a Jskad keyboard (i.e., a .ini file in the desired
      format).  In practice, only ACIP and some Wylie variants are
      used for storing Tibetan, but the mechanism is general. (This
      will be in UTF8 with no metadata)
    </li>
  </ul>


<p>
  The converter will attempt to accept input that has minor flaws, but
  it will also have a mode that rejects input with even the slightest
  flaw.
</p>


<h3>Output formats</h3>

<p>
  The converter will support, in a modular fashion, outputting a
  TibetanDocument that is <b>entirely Tibetan, entirely Roman, or a
  mix of Tibetan and Roman</b>, to the following output formats:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A proprietary, not-very-well-thought-out XML file of David
      Chandler's design.  For ease of imputation, let's say that this
      will adhere to the LetterByLetterTibetanAndRomanDocument DTD.
      This is useful for testing the software.  Also useful because it
      can easily be transformed into as-yet-unthought-of output
      formats.
    </li>
    <li>
      Extended Wylie or ACIP (inside a trivial XML[UTF8] document that
      describes the tool that output this file and links to a
      versioned DTD on the THDL web server) [only these two are used,
      but we could generate output in the TCC keyboard #1
      "transliteration" because the mechanism is general]
    </li>
    <li>
      Unicode (DLC: in which order for consonantal stacks? also,
      normalized or not?)
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for TibetanMachine
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for TibetanMachineWeb
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for Sambhota Old
    </li>
    <li>
      RTF for Sambhota New
    </li>
    <li>
      Edward and Than's XHTML
    </li>
    <li>
      XML that is much leaner and has &lt;tibetan translit="acip |
      extended-wylie"&gt; and &lt;roman&gt; tags (just a minimum of
      them).  This will be according to the not-yet-in-existence
      SimpleTibetanAndRomanDocument DTD.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  The converter will support, in a modular fashion, outputting a
  TibetanDocument that contains <b>only Tibetan and no Roman text</b>
  to the following additional output formats:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Extended Wylie, ACIP, and any other format for which there
      exists a Jskad keyboard (i.e., a .ini file in the desired
      format).  In practice, only ACIP and some Wylie variants are
      used for storing Tibetan, but the mechanism is general. (This
      will be in UTF8 with no metadata)
    </li>
    <li>
      Phonetic Tibetan (ACIP loose standard)
    </li>
    <li>
      Phonetic Tibetan (THDL standard)
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
What formats am I missing?  E-mail <a
href="mailto:dchandler@users.sourceforge.net">me</a> them.
</p>

<h3>Advantages and Benefits</h3>

<p>
  After this work item is completed, Jskad will be a powerful viewer
  of the various input formats described above.
</p>

<p>
  Command-line tools will exist to convert to-and-fro this-and-that.
  The most useful conversions will be to-and-from Unicode.  This will
  allow long-term storage in a format that will exist for years, while
  still allowing day-to-day work on systems without support for
  rendering Unicode.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, it will be possible with a little extra work to use
  Jskad as an HTML source editor rather than notepad.  You can save as
  the ugly, uneditable XHTML source that browsers can display, or
  preview in your system's default browser.
</p>

<p>
  Edward envisions a servlet that allows users to paste in, type in,
  or upload Tibetan in their format of choice.  This will be shown on
  the left side of the web page.  Upon identifying that format
  (perhaps the servlet will make an educated guess, even), they can
  then select any of our supported output formats and see the result
  (and download at their leisure) on the right half of the web page.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Plan</h3>

<p>
  To implement this converter, we will do the following:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Have TibetanDocument output a dense XML document that adheres to
      the LetterByLetterTibetanAndRomanDocument DTD.
    </li>
    <li>
      Play with XSLT and use it where appropriate to create output.
    </li>
    <li>
      Get the keyboard input logic out of org.thdl.tib.input.DuffPane.
      At this point, it will be possible to programmatically simulate
      a human user at the keyboard.  Automated tests that certain
      Tibetan keyboards are working correctly will be performed at
      this point, and these tests will work off the
      LetterByLetterTibetanAndRomanDocument that TibetanDocument was
      made to output above.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a command-line tool to convert from ACIP or Extended
      Wylie to the currently supported output formats using Chandler's
      modified gengetopt-2.4 [dubbed 2.4j] for command-line parameter
      processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add "Save As
      [Unicode|Extended-Wylie|ACIP|XHTML|RTF(TMW)|RTF(SambhotaNew)|...]" 
      options to Jskad.
    </li>
    <li>
      Code up Edward's servlet (described above).
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>
DLC: address fault-tolerance etc.
</p>
