<h2>Tibetan Machine Web Converter</h2>

<p>
  In the same JAR file as Jskad, power users will find a command-line
  utility that converts Tibetan documents from one digital
  representation to another.&nbsp; The converter embodies the same
  technology as Jskad itself, but often works even when Jskad fails
  due to Java's presently poor support for viewing RTF
  documents.&nbsp; This command-line utility converts a Tibetan
  Machine Web-encoded (TMW-encoded) Rich Text Format (RTF) file to
  either of these three output formats:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>RTF files in Unicode</li>
  <li>RTF files with the appropriate THDL Extended Wylie (Wylie) used
   instead of TMW</li>
  <li>RTF files in Tibetan Machine (used in legacy systems)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition, this converter can convert Tibetan Machine RTF files to
  Tibetan Machine Web RTF files, and takes precautions to ensure that
  only a 100% perfect conversion is done in both directions
  (TM-&gt;TMW and TMW&gt;TM).&nbsp; One such precaution is that two
  independent teams (Garrett and Garson, Chandler) turned the Tibetan
  Machine Web <a
  href="http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/tools/tmw.html#doc">
  documentation</a> into TM&lt;-&gt;TMW tables.&nbsp; These tables
  were compared, giving full confidence that the tables are as
  accurate as the documentation (which has a <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=746871&group_id=61934&atid=502515">
  few flaws</a> itself).&nbsp; That documentation has not been
  extensively verified against the actual fonts, however.&nbsp;
  Another precaution is that any unknown characters cause the
  conversion to fail, and the result is a document containing merely
  the unknown characters.&nbsp; (There are some known, illegal glyphs
  created by Tibet Doc, and the converter handles the ones it knows of
  and treats the rest as unknown.)
</p>

<p>
  This converter is smart enough to solve the &quot;curly-brace
  problem&quot;, wherein Tahoma '{', '}', and '\' characters appear
  instead of the TMW stacks they are supposed to represent.&nbsp; This
  problem originates with certain versions of Microsoft Word's Rich
  Text Format writing capabilities.
</p>

<p>
  Further, this converter gives a polite error message when a given
  .rtf file simply cannot be read by the version of Java used.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps most importantly, the converter has a
  <tt>--find-some-non-tmw</tt> mode of operation that gives you, the
  user, confidence that RTF reading and writing idiosyncrasies are not
  going to interfere with a flawless conversion.&nbsp; It does so by
  printing out the first occurrence of a given character in a non-TMW
  font.&nbsp; Here is some example output:
</p>
<pre>
java -cp "c:\my thdl tools\Jskad.jar" \
     org.thdl.tib.input.TibetanConverter \
        --find-some-non-tmw \
        "Dalai Lama Fifth History 01.rtf"

Non-TMW character newline [decimal 10] in the font Tahoma appears first at location 39
Non-TMW character ' ' [decimal 32] in the font TimesNewRoman appears first at location 45
Non-TMW character '}' [decimal 125] in the font Tahoma appears first at location 66
Non-TMW character '{' [decimal 123] in the font Tahoma appears first at location 219
Non-TMW character '\' [decimal 92] in the font Tahoma appears first at location 1237
Non-TMW character newline [decimal 10] in the font Times New Roman appears first at location 9754
</pre>

<p>
  Given the above output, you can be sure that a flawless conversion
  (barring the appearance of <a href="#knownbugs">known bugs</a>) will
  result when you run <tt>java -cp "c:\my thdl tools\Jskad.jar"
  org.thdl.tib.input.TibetanConverter --to-wylie "Dalai Lama Fifth
  History 01.rtf" &gt; "Dalai Lama Fifth History 01 in THDL Extended
  Wylie.rtf"</tt>.&nbsp; (Note that the '&gt;' causes the output to be
  directed to the file named thereafter; this is quite handy.)&nbsp;
  This is because the only text in the input file besides Tibetan is
  whitespace and the Tahoma characters <tt>'{'</tt>, <tt>'}'</tt>, and
  <tt>'\'</tt>.  These Tahoma characters are understood by the tool;
  they are symptoms of the &quot;curly-brace problem&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Failed Conversions</h3>

<p>
  In this section, you'll learn how to tell if a conversion has
  succeeded in full, ran into minor problems, or failed altogether.
</p>

<h4>TMW to Wylie</h4>

<p>
  Note that some TMW glyphs have no transliteration in Exteded
  Wylie.&nbsp; When you encounter such a glyph, you'll find
  <tt>\tmwXYYY</tt> in your output, where X tells you which TMW font
  the troublesome glyph comes from and YYY is the decimal number of
  the glyph in that font (which is a number between 000 and 255
  inclusive, usually between 33 and 126).&nbsp; The following are
  values corresponding to X:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    When X is 0, the TibetanMachineWeb font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 1, the TibetanMachineWeb1 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 2, the TibetanMachineWeb2 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 3, the TibetanMachineWeb3 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 4, the TibetanMachineWeb4 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 5, the TibetanMachineWeb5 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 6, the TibetanMachineWeb6 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 7, the TibetanMachineWeb7 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 8, the TibetanMachineWeb8 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
  <li>
    When X is 9, the TibetanMachineWeb9 font contains the glyph.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Upon finding a <tt>\tmwXYYY</tt> sequence in your output, you should
  consult the <a
  href="http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/tools/tmw.html#doc">
  documentation</a> for the specific TMW font named.&nbsp; Find the
  glyph (by its YYY value) and decide how to proceed.&nbsp; If you
  find a glyph that you believe should have been converted into
  Extended Wylie by the tool, please report this as a bug through the
  SourceForge website or via e-mail.
</p>

<h4>Other Conversions</h4>

<p>
  The other conversions are all-or-nothing.&nbsp; That is, if you run
  into any trouble whatsoever, the result will be a file containing
  just the problematic glyphs, each preceded by achen (i.e., U+0F68,
  the letter whose THDL Extended Wylie representation is 'a').&nbsp;
  These glyphs will be bracketed on the left by U+0F3C (for which the
  THDL Extended Wylie is '(') and on the right by U+0F3D (for which
  the THDL Extended Wylie is ')').&nbsp; If your result is as long as
  your input, then the conversion went flawlessly.
</p>

<p>
  There is one TMW glyph (TibetanMachineWeb7, glyph 91 [\tmw7091])
  that has no Tibetan Machine equivalent.&nbsp; This glyph is the only
  TMW glyph that can cause a TMW-&gt;TM conversion to fail.&nbsp; It
  is fairly common, though, especially if you've used Jskad to prepare
  your document.&nbsp; It might be appropriate to change the document
  to use TibetanMachineWeb7, glyph 90 [\tmw7090], a similar glyph that
  does have a TM equivalent.
</p>

<p>
  You might consider using Jskad to convert documents that give
  errors, as it has better error reporting and can tell you just
  what's wrong.
</p>
<p>
  If you ever encounter problems in a TM-&gt;TMW conversion, please
  send us mail with the error report (and the problem input document's
  resulting document) so that we can improve our tools.
</p>

<h3>Invoking the Converter</h3>

<p>
  First add Jskad.jar to your CLASSPATH.&nbsp; You can do this by
  setting an environment variable CLASSPATH to contain the absolute
  path of the Jskad.jar file and then running the command <tt>java
  org.thdl.tib.input.TibetanConverter</tt>.&nbsp; Alternatively, you
  can use <code>java -cp "c:\my tibetan documents\Jskad.jar"
  org.thdl.tib.input.TibetanConverter</code> where you put in the
  appropriate path to Jskad.jar.&nbsp; You will see usage information
  appear if you do this correctly; you'll see a message like
  <code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
  org/thdl/tib/input/TibetanConverter; Exception in thread
  "main"</code> if you've not correctly told Java where to find
  Jskad.jar.
</p>

<h3><a name="knownbugs"></a>Known Bugs</h3>

<p>
  All known bugs are listed in this section.&nbsp; They're more likely
  to be fixed if users complain, so complain away.
</p>

<p>
  First, if the TMW given is not syntactically legal, then the Wylie
  that results will not necessarily yield, if imported into Jskad, the
  same Tibetan with which the converter started.&nbsp; The glyphs
  corresponding to the Wylie 'jaskadaskeda' have this problem, for
  example.
