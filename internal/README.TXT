Don't check out this module.  It once contained a perl script that is
currently named CVSROOT/execlog.pl, but that kludge luckily failed,
forcing me to learn the right way to do things.

In the future, this module should be used for things that we want
under CVS control but do not want to release to the public.  I can't
think of anything that fits that bill at the moment.
